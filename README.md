# Form-Validation
## Develop the Webpage:
- Create an index.html file in your repository.
- Design two forms. One with HTML5 validation and one with JS validation.
### HTML5 Validation (updated): Design a form in the webpage that includes
- A text input field for a username with JavaScript validation for length (minimum 5 characters).
- An email input field with HTML5 validation
Additional input fields of your choice with HTML5 validation (e.g., password, number range, required checkboxes).
- A submit button.
- Optional: include CSS for :valid and :invalid inputs
### JavaScript (updated): Design a form within the webpage that includes:
- A text input field for a username with JavaScript validation for length (minimum 5 characters).
- An email input field with a JavaScript regex validation. (Use those Google skills!)
- Additional input fields of your choice with HTML5 validation (e.g., password, number range, required checkboxes).
- A submit button.

Include comments in the code explaining each form element, its validation purpose, and how the JavaScript validation works.
